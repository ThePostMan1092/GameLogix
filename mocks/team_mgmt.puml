Notes:
- Consider the metadata associated with teams (logos, mottos, etc)
- Consider ad hoc teams (all star teams, etc)
- consider the implications of arbitrarily sized teams - 
(may want to filter by size in downstream modals)
- this is an innnovation opportuntity - match eventType to team size
- consider deletion rules - what blocks team deletion/modification
- Consider RBAC roles in team management
